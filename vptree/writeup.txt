So it's partitioning the plane like a kd tree would.  I suppose that the point of this would be to do some kind of range queries later on.  
So, yes, I'd like to see some theory about construction time and search time, and why on earth :) this might be better than using straight lines with kd trees.  I think it's really interesting, if it has any advantages.  
The pseudocode can be shown but I wouldn't prioritize describing it.  I'm more curious about the time complexity of drawing this, because every new circle might have lots of existing objects to avoid cutting through.

At some point if you want to make the demo more interactive, you could display circles one by one, at least for one root-to-leaf path.  Ooh, or the user could select a leaf and you'd show the cuts that correspond to the ancestors of that leaf.  I'm sure there are plenty of other things we could think of.

It would be cool to see what behavior we have with this tree.  I can already think of a weird situation:
Suppose that you get a first circle, A, and inside you get a complete nested circle, B.  So now within A there are two regions, Bi in B and Bo outside of B.  Now it's possible to get a vantage point in Bo who's circle contains B.
So it's possible to get nested circles where you don't really have a correspondence to levels in the tree.  It's not as easy to figure out as a kd tree.
